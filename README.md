## About Me

My name is Mounika and I am a certified data analyst with a strong analytical background and a passion for data-driven decision-making. I have extensive experience in identifying patterns, trends, and insights that help businesses optimize their operations. My expertise includes data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis, and process optimization using tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python. Through a combination of professional experience, self-learning, and hands-on projects, I have developed a structured approach to solving complex business problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.

## What Have I Done?

My portfolio includes a diverse range of projects showcasing my data analysis and visualization skills. I have worked on retail sales analysis, customer behavior analysis, airline database insights, and funnel analysis of a food delivery app. These projects involve data wrangling, KPI tracking, interactive dashboards, and SQL-based insights. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful conclusions and present them in a way that supports strategic decision-making.

In addition to business intelligence and operational analysis, I have explored areas like predictive analytics, customer segmentation, and performance monitoring. My projects span multiple industries, including e-commerce, delivery applications, and customer service operations. 

Whether itâ€™s analyzing large datasets, optimizing workflows, or developing insightful reports, I am always eager to tackle new challenges and refine my skills in data analytics!!
